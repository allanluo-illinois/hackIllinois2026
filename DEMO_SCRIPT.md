## 📺 Overview
*[Visual: Show app logo and title screen]*

**[0:00-0:15]**

> "Meet CAT Inspector AI — an AI-powered field inspection system that transforms how fleet managers maintain heavy equipment. Built for CAT wheel loaders, this app turns routine maintenance checks into intelligent, data-driven operations.
>
> Watch how it works in the field."

## 🔧 SEGMENT 1: Field Inspection (0:15-1:15)

### Setup - Technician Starts Inspection
*[Visual: Show phone UI opening Inspector app, camera icon visible]*

> "A technician arrives at the yard with a CAT 950. They open Inspector AI and start a new session. The app has two powerful agents working behind the scenes: a **Generator Agent** that guides them through the inspection, and a **Reviewer Agent** that analyzes trends.
>
> The Generator Agent immediately asks for the machine's serial number and inspector name. Simple setup. No forms to fill out."

**[0:15-0:30]**

### The Multi-Modal Inspection Flow
*[Visual: Show the inspection UI with zones and components]*

> "Once they begin, the technician can inspect in whatever way works best. They're not confined to text. They can:"
>
> **1. Speak naturally** — *[Visual: Microphone icon, audio waves animating]* The app transcribes voice in real-time using advanced speech-to-text, so they can report findings as they walk around the machine.
>
> **2. Capture photos** — *[Visual: Photo/camera flow]* They point their phone at a component. The app uses **AI vision** to automatically **label and understand the location**, linking each photo directly to the right section.

**[0:30-0:50]**

---

### Auto-Labeling Magic
*[Visual: Phone camera takes a photo, AI labels appear in real-time (e.g., "Tire", "Hydraulic hose", "Battery terminal")]*

> "Here's where it gets intelligent. When the technician captures a photo of the tires, the **vision system automatically recognizes the zone and component**. It labels that photo and tracks it.
>
> Same with video — a 30-second video of the hydraulic system is automatically tagged and linked to the hydraulic section. No manual labeling. No data entry errors."

**[0:50-1:05]**

---

### Structured Reporting
*[Visual: Show inspection checklist updating in real-time — items turning green/yellow/red]*

> "The Generator Agent guides them through **four key sections**: Ground (tires, hydraulics, frame), Engine, Cab Exterior, and Cab Interior. With each finding — whether it's 'good,' 'monitor,' or 'critical' — the agent updates the report in real-time.
>
> Yellow flags trigger automatic photo capture. Red alerts lock in a detailed comment. Every photo is timestamped and linked to exactly where it was taken."

**[1:05-1:15]**

## 📊 SEGMENT 2: Management & Analytics (1:15-2:20)

### Dashboard Overview
*[Visual: Switch to management dashboard/reports tab]*

> "Once the inspection is complete, it's not just filed away. That's where the Reviewer Agent takes over."

**[1:15-1:25]**

---

### Historical Trend Analysis
*[Visual: Show report history list, graphs trending component health over time]*

> "Fleet managers can instantly pull up the **complete history** for any machine. They see:
>
> • **Condition trends** — Is the radiator degrading? Is hydraulic wear accelerating?
> • **Maintenance gaps** — Which components keep flagging yellow?
> • **Predictive alerts** — The AI identifies patterns before failures happen."

**[1:25-1:50]**

---

### AI-Generated Executive Reports
*[Visual: Show PDF report generation, final formatted document]*

> "With a single tap, managers generate formal **executive summaries**. The app translates field findings into professional language:
>
> • GREEN findings become 'PASS'
> • YELLOW findings become 'MONITOR'
> • RED findings become 'FAIL'
>
> The report includes linked photos, component-by-component analysis, and trend insights. It's boardroom-ready in seconds — no manual compilation."

**[1:50-2:15]**

---

### Editing & Collaboration
*[Visual: Show update/annotation UI for past reports]*

> "Did a technician miss a detail? No problem. Managers can update past reports with additional notes or observations. Everything is versioned, timestamped, and traceable."

**[2:15-2:20]**

## 🎯 SEGMENT 3: Impact & Close (2:20-3:00)

### Why This Matters
*[Visual: Montage of key features — voice input, photo auto-labeling, AI agents, reports]*

> "Three core innovations make this powerful:
>
> **First:** Multi-modal input. Technicians don't fight forms — they speak, point, and move.
>
> **Second:** Intelligent auto-labeling. Every photo knows its own location and component. No manual tagging.
>
> **Third:** Dual AI agents. The Generator guides field work with natural conversation. The Reviewer uncovers patterns in the data that matter."

**[2:20-2:45]**

---

### The Result
*[Visual: Time-lapse of inspection → report → dashboard]*

> "From field inspection to executive summary: **less than 10 minutes**. What once took hours of paperwork and manual entry now happens in real-time.
>
> Fleet downtime drops. Maintenance planning becomes predictive, not reactive. And every decision is backed by AI-analyzed data."

**[2:45-3:00]**

## 🎤 Speaker Notes

- **Pacing:** Conversational but confident. Pause briefly after key features so visuals register.
- **Tone:** Professional but accessible. Avoid jargon; explain "auto-labeling" and "trend analysis" with examples.
- **Energy:** Build momentum from individual tasks (field work) → broader insights (management analytics).
- **Demo Flow:** If live demoing, follow the same sequence — start with field inspection, then show reports and trends.
